### Introduction

How to champion visual design (change culture, convince others, etc.)

### Why aesthetics matter?

Visual design's impact on the bottom line is real.

For every $1 spent on visual design, return on value is $2-100.

Design-driven companies outperform S&P by 228% (Apple, Starbucks, Herman Miller, Nike, etc.)

1. Better customer satisfaction
2. Increased customer loyalty
3. Better employee retention
4. Customres become sales force

#### Mint

Spent $170 million on the UI

The #1 factor in site credibility is aesthetics

Took two identical bottles of wine, and the one with the expensive label tasted "better."

### Getting visual design thinking into your team?

#### Basillica

Every time there was a new pope, he brought on a new architect over the lifespan of the creation of the structure.

Decided to put together a steering committee; plan, design, hiring of the artist, etc.

In 1508, Rafael sees the frescoes and art, and ordered them to be destroyed. 

Michaelangelo "laid down the law," said just to take care of the funding, but leave the design and planning to me. 

#### Classification

1. Interaction designer
	* HCI trained
	* Product definition
	* User flows
2. Visual designer
	* Graphic design
	* Sensory-minded
	* Brand-centric

To make a designer successful, you have to empower him/her; give your visual designer accountability. 

#### Build a visual culture
Speak, work, carry out your aesthetic mission internally

#### How does a visual designer make an impact?
Find allies (developers, marketing, etc.)

The marketing team ended up paying for Windows' icons, screensavers, wallpapers, etc. 

Marketing teams understand branding, the value of design, etc.

Touch stuff outside of your scope (e.g. business cards, t-shirts, etc.)

Run formal critiques

### Fundamental aesthetic principles

#### Harmony
All parts relate to the whole; balance between atoms and molecules (atomic design)

> When one is delighted, things have the perception of working better.

### Tools & Processes

1. Futurecasting
	* Imagine what the end state will be and how the people will feel
	* Write the press release
	* Start with words
		* Interview key stakeholders
2. Positioning Matrices
	* Calibrate and decide on shift
3. Moodboards

Method that trumps all is **critique.**

Rules of the critique:

1. Visual designer is the owner & gets veto power
2. Write down agreed-upon goals and keywords on the whiteboard
3. Focus feedback on problems, not solutions
4. Don't try to get a final solution as a group
	* Compromise doesn't make great design

Say "I don't know what to focus on first," not "it's too cluttered"

### Recap

1. Be a champion for aesthetics
2. Express yourself (product / company)
3. Integrity, harmony, radience (aesthetic principles)
4. Respect the content; don't pander
5. Have a healthy appetite for dimension, texture, and details
6. Practice the art of critique
