## Just Enough Research

### Introduction

Erika has/had a tendency to always want to be right. It made her annoying and a terrible listener, and even less likely to be right. 

### Assumptions

Risks are assumptions. 

The bigger the gap between your assumptions and the real world, the greater the likelihood of risk and "hype." 

#### Segway

Was purported to change the world, but "whose world?"

#####  What does the failure teach us?

Asking the right questions will lead to better decisions and better answers. 

#### Color

Mobile photo application; received $41 million in funding. 

In less than a year and a half, their board and major investors shut it down.

### What is research?

Systematic inquiry; asking questions and being diligent about the answers.

#### Pure research

Carried out to uncover new human knowledge.

#### Applied research
Serves a specific real-world goal.

### What research is not

 - asking people what they like; has no correlation with behavior.
	- Customer satisfaction has a negligible effect on business success.
- asking people what they hate

### How to Research

#### One simple process

Form questions -> Gather Data -> Analyze Data

Gathering data:

1. A/B testing
2. Reading
3. Asking questions
4. etc.

Forming questions:

1. Specific
2. Answerable
3. Practical

##### Terrible question
> What do people do all day?

##### Good question
> How do we coordinate communication strategies?

### Why not just build a prototype?

Sometimes that can be the right kind of thing to do.

### How about a focus group?

No one's real life world looks like a focus group (e.g. someone else's conference room surrounded by strangers). 

> Even when the subjects are well selected, focus groups are suposed to be merely the source of ideas that need to be researched.

#### Focus groups are worthless
