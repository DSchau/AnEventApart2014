## UX Strategy Means Business

### Introduction

#### Montreal Gazette

NHL lockout occurred, strategy was devised to simulate/play games in NHL 13. 

1. Played NHL 13 video game hockey
2. Reported in the news the results of these games
	* Got more readers to the entire paper because of this reporting

#### The Gist

Posted funny articles (headlines, in particular) of regular news stories.

### Design: The Rendering of Intent

You can't separate great content from great design.. the intersection of the two is great UX. 

#### Airfield Ireland

Irish FAA was desperately afraid that the (non-existant) airfield would be used by pilots in distress. 

#### iOS 6 Maps

Faboulous interface, but if the content is wrong/broken/etc. it makes the entire experience *suck.*

Creating maps is an immensely difficult undertaking.

Google's strategy

* 1,300 data sources
* 1,000 people * 10 years of correcting map errors

Apple's strategy

* Acquired 3 mapping companies
* Used 10 data sources

Apple had a great strategy; Google had a better one. 

### Delivering the content is as important as the content itself

#### We use *strategy* to achieve a desired outcome

#### UX strategy can't predict outcomes

#### UX Strategy is broken

We have to go back to basics. 

The basics start with business models

### Designing Business Models

Amazon can sell every product at cost, and still make enough money to stay in business.

#### Amazon Cash Float Model

To explain the cash float, have to explain retail.

Inventory turn - amount of time it takes to take all product you've bought and sell it

Amazon turns inventory every 20 days
Best Buy turns inventory ever 74 days
Both companies take 45 days to pay (the supplier).

Best Buy, between days 44-76, is in debt
Amazon has 22 days of sitting on cash before they send to distributor

Amazon can invest that money and survive on that interest. 

#### Great business models are designed

#### What are our business model options?

##### Business Strategic Priorities

1. Increase Revenue
2. Reduce costs
3. Increase new business
4. Increase existing business
5. Increase shareholder value

Example: Zappos

Zappos decided to give free shipping on returns.

1. To keep service calls down, provide great instructions for the return process
	* Decreased costs
2. Provided a shipping label from UPS that would take care of all the costs associated
	* Decreased costs
	* Dramatically reduced costs because it increased UPS' workload (better contract)
	* Increased existing business
		* Increased revenue
	* Increased shareholder value

Example: Vanguard

Produce a variety of videos, articles offering investment advice; unclear how to map the content to the strategic priorities. 

### Advertising

#### Advertising should be the business model choice of last resort

An alternative needs to be proposed beyond/instead of advertising

### Alternatives to advertising

#### NYTimes Business Model

1. Rather than use (heavy) advertising and pagination, use a "paywall" limit when > 10 articles is read per month
	* Metered paywall
	* They make more money from the metered paywall than they did from advertising
2. Resulting affects
	* Increase new business
	* Increase existing business
	* Increase revenue
	* Increase shareholder value

#### Repurposed Content

Grammar girl sells recordings/books of her blog content.

#### Supporting Product Sales

Writes blogs on how to do technology repair/improvement. Sell the tools to do the repair(s). 

#### In-app Purchases

Biggest sellers are ways to cheat within game. 

#### Alternative Channel Revenue

Taking most popular shows and filling theaters doing live performances. 

#### Content Distribution

iTunes, Amazon, & Tesco

### Delightful content adds real value

#### Michigan research grads

Bought a $3.00 "piece of junk," created an in-depth story (made up) and re-sold the piece for $197.50

#### Given money to search Wal-Mart, Crutchfield, etc.

Crutchfield (which writes its own reviews, content for products) received 237% of initial purchase amount; Wal-mart got 89% (with manufacturer pasted reviews)

1. Create delightful experiences
2. Use a business model mapped to strategic properties
3. Profit

#### The best UX strategiests create delight by working in the intersection of business & design
