## Understanding Web Design
### Jeffrey Zeldman

Starting to get to a situation where your boss, stakeholders, etc. understand your work

Art Directors Club

 * Hired greatest architect of day, Stanford White, to build their original headquarters
 * Wanted to make a splash, to get acclaim
 * Wouldn't have the aesthetic/professional criteria for art direction without this club
 * Would have been like hiring Jay-Z for your daughter's 16th birthday party

We have all kinds of metrics for if our website works, e.g. click rate, etc. but we don't have metrics for "boundary pushing, greatness, etc."

"It's interactive if it's on the internet." - art directory

Web sites that win awards but don't get views aren't really web sites.

Some companies are being trained that websites are "afterthoughts."
 * As long as this continues, it's difficult to defend things like responsive design, etc.

### The Mystery of Web Design

How can we make it clearer what we're doing and why it matters?

Had a great campaign for VH1; edgy, intelligent, etc. and would have changed VH1 forever:

 * Creative director presented the campaign and the clients said they loved it
  * However, asked for a different typeface
   * Creative director says no, and walks out of the room

Good agencies saw clients as standing in the way of good work; bad agencies saw them as merely cash cows, wanted to sell stuff

Batman story; didn't understand the character; "Batman doesn't talk"

Can persuade a client by understanding/caring about what is important to them

Webby's don't have an aesthetic criteria

 * Not really about interaction design; they're the celebrity roasts of awards

.net Magazine Awards

 * all the judges are web/ux people; fairly valid results
 * Only people who pay attention are web developers & designers

W3C can't explain the value of the web for the people we work for

Apple, Adobe, Mozilla, Google, etc. can't represent us; only provide us with tools

Facebook's switch from HTML5 app to native iOS application

 * Everyone agreed that the HTML5 application was slow, sluggish, etc.
 * Didn't just frustate users, frustated Facebook's strategic business goal
  * Facebook had started as a web company, but (wanted to) redefine as a mobile company; hard to do so when your mobile app sucks
  *  Press framed it in Facebook's terms (HTML5 is slow); no one took the time to treat it as a design problem, instead of a code problem

Asking the wrong question; start with design, goals, and users

Instead of trying to emulate the slickness of the desktop experience, should've found what users loved about Facebook, figured out how to deliver it on mobile in the simplest and fastest way

 * Fix mobile and then fix desktop (mobile first)
 * Mobile forces you to figure out what people really want

Anything that interferes with the users getting stuff done is bad.

Facebook approached mobile as a technology problem, when it was really a design problem.

### We don't design for browsers

It's important to remember that it's about people.
 * You don't validate, make site accessible, etc. for inherent reasons

You get better design results when you understand your medium.

### Web design is not like other kinds of design

It's a form that lets other people express themselves; like architechture, type design, etc.

We make what we think will be used by certain people, and over time it (may) change

The secret of design is the details, like the secret to comedy is timing.
