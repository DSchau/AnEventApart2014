### Kate Kiefer Lee (mailchimp)


#### Touchy Subjects

* Health and medicine
* money and banking
* private information
* fundraising
* religion
* politics

### Content Types

#### Urgent Messages

Bad news, usually time sensitive; error messages, downtime notifications, warnings and compliance alerts, apologies, etc.

#### Less Urgent Messages

Help docs, customer service emails, contact pages, forms, unsubscribe pages, etc.

#### Sensitive Subjects

Map anything that could be considered bad news, sensitive, etc. (e.g. feedback alert)

How do you talk to someone who is frustrated, stressed, and angry (in real life)? Gentle, calm, serious. 

Map a (sequence of) tones to the reader's feelings.

#### Principles for Sensitive Situations

* Be clear
* Get to the point
	* e.g. if a family member calls you late at night; don't be verbose
* stay calm
	* Don't use words like alert, immediately, etc. 
	* Makes them feel like you're scolding them
	* Avoid all caps and exclamation marks
* be serious
* accept responsibility
* be nice

### Error Messages and Alerts

How do you talk to people who are frustated, feeling stress or annoyed?

#### Classic Error Message (Credit Card Expiration)

> We regret to inform you that we are unable to process this rqeuest, as the credit card you provided has expired.

Doesn't get to the point soon enough, too formal, etc.

> Oops… looks like you credit card is expired!

Too casual, comes off as flippant. 

> Your credit card has expired. Please try another card.

Better. Say exactly what you mean and say it nicely

#### Customer Service Messages

Often feeling frustated, stressed, confused, etc; Important to be helpful, friendly, straightforward.

Too formal, wastes time. 

Canned messages need to sound human, not wasting any time. 

#### Help documents

Readers may be confused, stressed, anticipated. 

Titles are super important; it's how people browse through articles. 

Keep the help documentation updated.

##### Voice should switch across content types

e.g. it's *ok* to have a sarcastic/humerous voice on a product page, but not necessarily with a "sensitive questions" page

#### Social Media

People post sensitive topics on social networks. 

Know time and place for tweets, context, etc.

#### Apologies

> Our apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.

"We apologize" is better, "We're sorry" is even better

Comes off as insincere.

The Atlantic's apology is a good one (in re: to the Scientology advertisement)

> We screwed up. It shouldn't have taken a wave of constructive criticism--but it has--…
