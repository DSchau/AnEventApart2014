## Mind the Gap: Designing in the Space Between Devices
### [Josh Clark](https://twitter.com/globalmoxie)

What happens when we get caught between devices that are already targeted?

### Multidevice

We have a lot of gadgets, and we're switching between them constantly. 

Average UK citizen switches between devices 21 times/hour. 

Google study found 90% accomplish tasks across multiple screens.

#### How do users continue tasks?

* Search
	* e.g. restart the task with a Google search
* email
* Text

### The Gap

* Remote control
	* Chromecast
* Email and SMS hacks
* Content syncing
	* Dropbox
	* Kindle/Netflix; asks if you would like to continue where you left off

### The Behavior Gap

We're becoming more and more sophisticated at making our content look great across devices. 

Apple's Continuity; Android's Nearby

#### Exchange "Across the Gap"

* Sequenced
	* A very linear process (e.g. shopping, forms, etc.)
* Simultaneous
	* Often we're doing multiple things on a device, at once
	* [Google Racer](g.co/racer)
	* Web RTC; exchange video/audio peer to peer
		* Direct browser to browser exchange
		* Sharing control/experience
	* Bluetooth LE
	* Web Audio API
		* Can "listen" to a non-audible sound, and do some action (e.g. login, authenticate, wake, etc.)

> It's not enough to share content across devices.
> 
> Share action.

> The best parts of our lives do not happen in front of a screen.

### Physical Interaction
New way to bridge the gap isn't through digital interactions, like a screen, keyboard, etc. but rather through a physical interaction.

#### Human -> Device interaction
Physical sensors on a person to perform some action (e.g. change powerpoint slide) 

#### Device -> Device Interaction

* Wearable devices
	* Misfit Shine (pedometer)
		* Use device on phone's screen to track steps (sync)

	* [Ring](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1761670738/ring-shortcut-everything)
	* [HP Leap Motion Envy](http://bitly.com/hp-leapmotion)
* [iOS -> OS X](https://github.com/houseoflegend/happytogether)

> It's a challenge of imagination.

We need to design the interactions; come up with clever, intuitive combinations for device -> device interaction.

> Never ever ever ever try to out-mouse the mouse.

### Physical & Digital

* Internet of things
	* We can embed sensors, "computers" in any old object to collapse the gap between digital & physical
* Social machines
	* Teddy Ruxpin
		* What would a social toy look like now?
		* Toymail
			* Can send messages through an application which is sent to a toy
			* Turns a toy into a personal communicator

> Anything that can be connected will be connected.

> Everyday objects are [or can be] digital gadgets.

> Physical things have digital avatars.

> Software makes hardware scale.

e.g. software in your phone (e.g. it controls Carplay) makes your car smarter when it gets an update

> Software is ideology embedded with values.

### Interactions

* Intentional
* Passive
	* e.g. Nest learning thermostat
* Social

Best applications (internet of things) tend to blend all 3 of these interactions seamlessly

Extend my intentional ability through a social interface, learn based on passive observations, etc.

### Imagination

* Plan for gadget hopping
	* Idea of moving from one device to another
* Share action
	* It's not just about syncing files; action, intention, etc.
* Peer-to-peer sharing
	* Devices need to talk to each other directly (Web Sockets, WebRTC, etc.)
* Offscreen interactions
* Design for sensors
* Avatar for objects
	* Represent all the information about that object in the digital realm; bring social interaction

> Managing transitions between computing devices could very well be **the primary software problem** of the next 5-10 years.

It's a challenge of imagination. We're not designing for screens, we're designing for people.
